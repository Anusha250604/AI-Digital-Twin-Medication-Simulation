# AI-Digital-Twin-Medication-Simulation
AI-powered digital twin healthcare web app with medication simulation
💊 AI-Powered Digital Twin with Smart Medication Simulation
📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered healthcare web app that creates a Digital Twin of a patient and simulates the effect of medication changes or missed doses. The system predicts health risks, visualizes future health trends, and provides real-time alerts for high-risk scenarios or drug interactions.

🚀 Features

✅ Patient Info Form – Input age, BP, glucose levels, and medication details
✅ Digital Twin Simulation – Predicts how missed doses affect health
✅ Dynamic Risk Calculation – AI logic estimates risk percentage
✅ Interactive Health Graph – Compare normal vs simulated scenarios
✅ Alerts & Warnings – Displays High Risk or Drug Interaction alerts
✅ Responsive Web UI – Built with Flask & Bootstrap

🖥️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5

Backend: Python (Flask)

Visualization: Plotly.js

Styling: Custom CSS
